git stash

git stash apply


A .gitignore file is a plain text file that contains a list of all the specified files and folders from the project that Git should ignore and not track.


Lets see how it works.

So first create a .gitignore file --> add the filename or directory path (from the present git path) that yopu want to be ignored. 
--> After that if you add all files by "git add ." ignored files will not be added.
